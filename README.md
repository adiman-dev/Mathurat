#Mathurat
A text based Al-Mathurat library

It is so hard to find a working text based Al-Mathurat in the web. People are sharing images instead of free text. So i created this repo.

Thank you [iwani](https://github.com/iwanikhalid) for helping on the arabic text

Feel free to use and do a pull request. 

##Contents
1. mathurat_sughra.odt : A raw text based Mathurat Sughra. 
2. mathurat_sughra_sqlite.sql.sql : A SQLite databse dump file complete with Bahasa Melayu translations

Currently i only have Sughra version :) Maybe next time will have Kubra also (need help!)
